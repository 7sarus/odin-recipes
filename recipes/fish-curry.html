    <h1>Fish Curry</h1>
        <img src="../images/fish-curry.jpg" alt="picture of fish curry"/>
        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>it is a basic fish curry that is cooked with kudum puli (Malabar Tamrind) and red chili powder. The curry has a vibrant red colour that comes from the chili powder. It can be made easily by bachelors as we don’t have to grind any masala here. As with all fish curries, I suggest that you make this curry in the morning and let it rest for couple of hours to get the best taste. The leftover curry stays good at room temperature and tastes even better the next day.</p>
